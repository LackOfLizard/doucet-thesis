Documents and Code associated with the survey/analysis of scale morphology in Squamata

---------------------

Combined_Data_Tree

NEXUS Mesquite file. Contains character matrices and pruned tree with only taxa sampled in my dataset. Character names are either taken from Reeder et al. 2013
or are original proposed character names that may not reflect final names seen in the thesis yet. However, character numbers are consistent with those in 
Appendix B of the thesis.

---------------------

Dataset.xlsx

Spreadsheet for use in R scripts provided in the repository. Taxa and character states taken directly from full character matrix in the NEXUS file.

---------------------

Morphospace.gif

Visualization of the morphospace generated in MCA.

---------------------

Phylomorphospace.rmd

R script for analyzing data using MCA. 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualization of data is available, as well as variable contribution analysis.

---------------------

Phytools_Analysis.rmd

R script for applying ancestral state reconstruction using the Markov model to my dataset on the pruned tree.

---------------------

Scale_NEWICK.phy

Pruned tree obtained from Pyron et al. 2013. Branch lengths are retained, though only taxa included in my sample are present.
For use in Phytools_Analysis.rmd
